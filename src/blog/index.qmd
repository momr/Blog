I am a Senior Software Engineer specializing in autonomous drilling optimization, machine learning-driven analytics, and advanced state estimation techniques. Over the past two years at SLB, Iâ€™ve contributed to projects that bridge complex drilling workflows with cutting-edge ML models, Bayesian filtering algorithms, and robust data engineering pipelines. My work spans from designing and integrating different Steering modes for drilling automation to implementing custom particle filters in C# for improved yield estimation under challenging non-linear, noisy conditions.

## ðŸ’¼ Work With Me

I stay current with advanced data ecosystems, leveraging tools like Dataiku, DCV, and GCP, and Iâ€™ve developed reproducible ML pipelines with scikit-learn and Optuna-driven hyperparameter optimization. Committed to innovation and continuous learning, Iâ€™ve presented ML findings to senior leadership, and fostered a culture of knowledge-sharing through workshops and mentorship. My approach emphasizes delivering measurable resultsâ€”improved operational efficiency, enhanced real-time analytics, and data-driven decision-makingâ€”to drive strategic impact within the energy sector.
