I am a Senior Software Engineer specializing in autonomous drilling optimization, machine learning-driven analytics, and advanced state estimation techniques. Over the past two years at SLB, Iâ€™ve contributed to projects that bridge complex drilling workflows with cutting-edge ML models, Bayesian filtering algorithms, and robust data engineering pipelines. My work spans from designing and integrating different Steering modes for drilling automation to implementing custom particle filters in C# for improved yield estimation under challenging non-linear, noisy conditions.
